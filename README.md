# Dark Light Toggle Switch

This project demonstrates how to create a toggle switch to switch between dark and light modes. The toggle switch provides a smooth transition between the two themes using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Toggle between dark mode and light mode.
- Smooth transition effect for theme change.
- Responsive and mobile-friendly.
- Simple and clean design.

## Demo

You can view the live demo of the toggle switch [here](https://your-github-pages-link-here).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the webpage and creating the layout.
- **CSS3**: For styling the page, toggle button, and implementing the smooth transition effect.
- **JavaScript**: For adding the functionality to toggle between light and dark modes dynamically.

  
## How It Works

1. The `toggle-container` is styled as a toggle button, which is clickable.
2. When clicked, it toggles the `dark` class on itself.
3. Based on the presence of the `dark` class:
   - The background and text color of the body are changed to reflect the selected mode.
   - The toggle switch slider is moved to indicate the current mode.
   - The background of the toggle switch changes to match the current mode.
